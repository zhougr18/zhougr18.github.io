I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST), Tsinghua University, affiliated with the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, supervised by Prof. [Hua Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oyOaLDEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on multimodal intent understanding, multimodal reasoning, and lightweight multimodal large language models. I am also broadly interested in open-set recognition, clustering, and efficient multimodal machine learning. I have published several papers at the top international AI journals and conferences such as ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, ACM MM, IEEE TMM, and IEEE/ACM TASLP, which have been cited over **300** times on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nzQYQ6QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
